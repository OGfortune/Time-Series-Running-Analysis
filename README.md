This repository contains the code and analysis for  on classifying time series data from accelerometer sensors worn by recreational runners. The project evaluates the effectiveness of different models, including logistic regression, Rocket transformer, and alternative classifiers, on fatigued and non-fatigued running strides for two subjects, A and B. The analysis includes baseline accuracy calculation, assessment with the Rocket transformer, evaluation of alternative classifiers and normalization techniques, and testing of the Rocket transformer with different kernel numbers. The findings are presented in the RunningCore Python notebook with detailed explanations and insights.
